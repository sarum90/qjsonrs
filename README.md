# qjsonrs

A Rust implementation of a JSON Tokenizer.

## Warning

This crate is still very unstable, and probably going to have many breaking
changes while in the 0.x.y versions.

## Motivation

Streaming tokenization for handling large JSON payloads which can be processed
without loading the whole JSON object into memory.

## Iterator interface.

The steam of JsonTokens emitted by this crate unfortunately cannot quite
provide the Iter interface. The reason is: the emitted JsonTokens refer to an
internal buffer of the stream, and thus maintain a reference to the stream.

Also, the iterator returns Results, to enable reporting of IO or JSON encoding errors.
